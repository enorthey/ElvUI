subversion:
	- Omega via svn r7335: change the vortex to also use anti spam instead of CiD, the rest have to stay the way they are though. because that's how encounter is designed, if you pull twin out of range of morchok, you're just not going to get the 5-6 second mimic timer. But you'll get the cast warnings still so you'll live.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7334: # DSTrash : oops forgot to remove old one.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7333: # Morchok : fix lua error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7332: # DSTrash : do not not warn when Drakes count below 0.
	- Omega via svn r7331: Madness updates
	- Omega via svn r7330: Fix shannox trap scanning hopefully, it seems shannox is no longer boss1 (or any boss, his boss unit id was removed, wtf?)
	- Snamor via svn r7329: esES update
	- ebmor via svn r7328: deDE update (DragonSoul)
	- Omega via svn r7327: The timer should cancel after 15 drakes die, the secondary checks probably won't be needed now that drake count is changed to sync, but leaving em anyways as redundancy doesn't hurt anything.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7326: # Morchok : prevent double warn on Furious warning.
