subversion:
	- DiabloHu via svn r7403: zhCN update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7402: # Zonozz : Fix first Psychic Drain timer.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7401: # Blackhorn : Fix for harpoons bug. Change harpoon timer to cd timer. (see comments)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7400: # Fandral Staghelm : Update ability timer (18 stack at 3.7) # Rhyolith : Fix first Heated Volcano timer (seems to changed in 4.3)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7399: # Yorsahj : fix error.
	- Omega via svn r7398: Update yorsahj special warning to warn at 2 stacks not 3. there is no reason for a tank to have more then 2 stacks post nerf (unless you're just solo tanking in which case you probably want to just turn this warning off) Also added a warning for other tank to taunt at 2 stacks also. even if youre debuff isn't clear yet, you taunt when other tank is at 2 stacks, because it WILL be clear before next cast, trust me. 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 is flawless post 12 second debuff duration nerf.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7397: # Hagara : Fix Shattering CD bar not canceling on special phase. # Yorsahj : Added Mana Void debuff fades bar.
	- Omega via svn r7396: add unit role filtering so it doesn't actually call out healers or tanks that are doing something else. It will only name damagers or undefined (so if you want it to be more accurate, do a roll check outside LFR for this feature)
	- Omega via svn r7395: Add info frame that can detect who's not targeting something they should be. Usage:
	/script DBM.InfoFrame:Show(5, "playertargets", 56188)
	Show all players not targeting blistering tentacles
	- Omega via svn r7394: for good measure, lets just say savedDifficulty = "" on load vs making it a nil value to begin with.
	- Omega via svn r7393: when doing difficulty recovery, lets find out what it actually is. also, shortened and simplified the normal10 difficulty check to figure out player size in a cleaner way.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7392: # Core : Fix rare nil savedDifficulty error. # Firelands/Baleroc : Fix strike spellName error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7391: # koKR update (core)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7390: # Blackhorn : fix spellId case to match other mods.
	- Omega via svn r7389: even more tank debuff stuff.
	- Omega via svn r7388: Add some phase 2 tank debuff tracking
	- Omega via svn r7387: ah fix more stuff, some of the trash mods weren't limited to their proper zone, this is now fixed too.
	- Omega via svn r7386: More of the same
	- Omega via svn r7385: Reduce needless function usage when there is only one spellid for a UNIT event (ie, don't call GetSpellInfo if we don't need to). In events we DO need to GetSpellInfo call it only once. Trivial things, but better code/cpu usage none the less :)
	Fights in current tier cause extraodordinary hit on even some of the most decent computers with how many mods are overwhelmed by their data. Improving the game one function at a time, one mod at a time ;)
	- Snamor via svn r7384: esES update
	- thiagovfar via svn r7383: ptBR update
	Adding/removing localizations strings that I've missed on r7368.
	- ebmor via svn r7382: BWD Omnotron Defense System: fix Encasing Shadows yell (seems to be broken since r5518)
	- ebmor via svn r7381: deDe update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7380: # Madness of Deathwing : Remove Parasite canceling. I have bad log. sorry. (-
	- Omega via svn r7379: no reason to check difficulty when canceling timers, that's just extra code. I'm not even sure why you'd need to cancel parasite here to be honest. That timer is canceled when corruption dies, and corruption ALWAYS dies before arm/wing? Unless maybe a bug where the cast can show in combat log after it dies? guess that's probably why.
	- Omega via svn r7378: *Comment cleanup. *Changed 3 world bosses to only register events in combat, since they have no mobs even remotely near em that could possibly mess up combat regen pull detection. *Event tweaks on al'akir (another particularly brutal fight on combat log/fps on 25 man)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7377: # Madness of Deathwing : Also cancels Parasite timer on heroic.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7376: # Madness of Deathwing : Change phase 1 timer canceling. If wing or arm dies same time on Cataclysm casting, Cataclysm timer not cancels. This fix will fix this problem (hopefully).
	- nbluewiz via svn r7375: # Madness of Deathwing : Change Shrapnel timer to personal timer. Also Shrapnel target warning off by default (too spammy on 25-man). And cancels countdown and timer when Shrapnel fades from player.
	- Omega via svn r7374: chamge hemorage back to spell warning, you don't actively switch to them on heroic, you keep them up on purpose to gimmick spellweave onto parasites and corruption, then kill them. So for this one, we'll leave the "switch" call to the raid leader.
	- Omega via svn r7373: oops, only register health update on heroic, since we don't need it on normal. no reason to add heroic check to health event then either since it won't even be activated there ;)
	- Omega via svn r7372: Add a pre warn for congealingblood. Make sure it's faster by using FREQUENT health method (as a result, using short term events to register it so it's not being used entire fight)
	- ultrashining via svn r7371: zhTW update (blank clean up, pvp update)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7370: # Core : RegisterEventsShortTerm -> RegisterShortTermEvents
	- Omega via svn r7369: Remove un-needed checks from sending sync kill sync, that spell is a unique spellid that's only ever cast at one point in fight, the end. he uses a different spellid at beginning of fight. Instead just make sure we're in combat before trying to end combat (otherwise there is no point)
	- thiagovfar via svn r7368: ptBR update
	Wild localization strings appeared (some others got away), while I was
	away.
	
	I'm also cleaning up my locals, as Omega did just now.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7367: # koKR update (remove blank)
	- Omega via svn r7366: More trash stuff. Kill off first charge timer on BWD trash, it's an ugly hack/hog with no clean workaround Disable flamestrike when council is pulled and only register it on flamestrike casts for BoT trash
	- Omega via svn r7365: rename Partly to ShortTerm. "Partly" signifies something that's only partially registered, but that's not true, it's fully registered, just only temporarily. "Short Term" is a more accurate description of the function. Applied short term event registeration usage to firelands trash mods as well. Did some useless locals cleanup to reduce locals size and loading time. No sense in having a ton of empty tables. Removed firelands trash range finder. that's just silly. Like no one uses it, and to even make it work we have to do all kinds of ugly hacking. It's better off gone.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7364: # koKR update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7363: # DSTrash : Oops, forgot to remove debug code.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7362: # Core : Added partly register event support. Refer to DSTrash. # DSTrash : High volume events (SPELL_DAMAGE, SWING_DAMAGE, ...) now using Drake event only. It will resolve performance issue.
	- DiabloHu via svn r7361: zhCN update
	- thiagovfar via svn r7360: ptBR update
	Some triggers for dragon soul, end time and hour of twilight.
	
	I'm also updating the "translation by" string, Since I have lost my toon's
	name on a realm transfer.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7359: # DSTrash : Performance tweak + Removed sync stuff. (As I watched, UNIT_DIED event not related combat log range. It seems that blizz's bug. And Omega's overkill hack works very good with not syncing.) # Blackhorn, Morchok, Spine of Deathwing : Remove useless variables like SPELL_DAMAGE event. # Occuthar : Changed overkill hack like DSTrash. # Ragnaros, Shannox : Sometimes trap target returns "Unknown" or "none". Filter this. + And GetPartyAssignment function not needs 3rd parameter if 2nd parameter is uId. Remove that.
	- Omega via svn r7358: Add blood warning for phase 2 madness
	- Omega via svn r7357: Move the parasite dps warning to the right place, so it actually doesn't fire 3-4 seconds late
	- Omega via svn r7356: ok this should fix the errors. i guess RANGE_DAMAGE has same args as spell events, not melee events. ok then.
	- Omega via svn r7355: comment this out for now, will fix after raid when i have more time
	- Omega via svn r7354: Forgot something, NOW it should be working heh
	- Omega via svn r7353: Fix a small bug in that though. because SPELL_PERIODIC_DAMAGE does NOT equal SWING_DAMAGE. Oops
	- Omega via svn r7352: Confirmed overkill method works, add more events for tracking it.
	- Omega via svn r7351: oops forgot to register swing damage
	- Omega via svn r7350: *Fix skyrim drakes same way we fix same problem on occuthar. If they fail to fire UNIT_DIED< then we'll just track overkill damage as well *Disabled EoE portal timer. It's only reliable if the FIRST Person up there is running latest alpha, otherwise it utterly fails. The problem is the RP event is indvidualized, it starts when YOU get up there, not when first person gets up there, so it's wrong for 24 out of 25 people or 9 out of 10 people, it's only right for FIRST person up there. We cannot control whether that person is running DBM or not though, if they aren't then it's worthless :(
	- Omega via svn r7349: Try this trash fix.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7348: # DSTrash : comment update
	- nbluewiz via svn r7347: # DSTrash : 1. Adjust portal timer. 2. Fix portal sync problem. 3. Updated drake stuff comment. # Hagara : 1. Added count to Assault warning and timer. 2. Next Ice Lance and Assault timer not shows when these spells not coming. # Spine of Deathwing : Also reduces delay of Absorbed Blood stack warning to 1.25.
	- Snamor via svn r7346: esES update
	- Omega via svn r7345: *Remove health check from tank checks, it's not going to scale well with any accuracy, it'll reduce tank detection when people don't set roles but that's on them. *Improvements to trapscanners for rag and shannox, rag mainly to prevent the kind of breaking shannox mod got in case blizzard ever removes boss1 from him too, and shannox just a slight code tweak.
	- ultrashining via svn r7344: zhTW update
	- ebmor via svn r7343: deDE update (Core, WorldEvents)
	- nbluewiz via svn r7342: # koKR update (core)
	- DiabloHu via svn r7341: zhCN update
	- Omega via svn r7340: update last to use quest progress if available otherwise post generic message if not
	- Omega via svn r7339: Start of point tracking for Whack a Gnoll, todo, figure out how to track how many points PLAYER has earned out of that max total. cannot find an event at least tracked by transcriptor. COuld possibly register and watch quest progress update events, BUT what if you aren't on quest, and just want to free for all practice? Gotta be another way to track this besides quests.
	- tandanu via svn r7338: Add best guess for lowest boss health in the current fight to the combat end message.
	The following localization variables have been renamed and modified:
	DBM_CORE_COMBAT_ENDED --> DBM_CORE_COMBAT_ENDED_AT
	DBM_CORE_WHISPER_COMBAT_END_WIPE --> DBM_CORE_WHISPER_COMBAT_END_WIPE_AT
	
	Both have a new parameter %s for the boss status.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7337: # Morchok : typo
	- ebmor via svn r7336: fix lua error
	- Omega via svn r7335: change the vortex to also use anti spam instead of CiD, the rest have to stay the way they are though. because that's how encounter is designed, if you pull twin out of range of morchok, you're just not going to get the 5-6 second mimic timer. But you'll get the cast warnings still so you'll live.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7334: # DSTrash : oops forgot to remove old one.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7333: # Morchok : fix lua error.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7332: # DSTrash : do not not warn when Drakes count below 0.
	- Omega via svn r7331: Madness updates
	- Omega via svn r7330: Fix shannox trap scanning hopefully, it seems shannox is no longer boss1 (or any boss, his boss unit id was removed, wtf?)
	- Snamor via svn r7329: esES update
	- ebmor via svn r7328: deDE update (DragonSoul)
	- Omega via svn r7327: The timer should cancel after 15 drakes die, the secondary checks probably won't be needed now that drake count is changed to sync, but leaving em anyways as redundancy doesn't hurt anything.
	- nbluewiz via svn r7326: # Morchok : prevent double warn on Furious warning.
